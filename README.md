# Machine Learning Model Evaluation for Cancer Type Prediction

This repository contains the code for evaluating and comparing the performance of 8 different machine learning classification models on a dataset. The models tested include Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, Gradient Boosting, and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The objective of this project is to assess the accuracy and effectiveness of these models in classification tasks.

## Code Structure
- `classification_evaluation.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
- `cancer_type.csv`: CSV file containing the dataset used in the project.

## Evaluated Metrices
 **Accuracy**
 **F1 Score**
 **Confusion Matrix**

## Models Evaluated
 **Logistic Regression**
 **Decision Tree**
 **Random Forest**
 **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
 **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
 **Naive Bayes**
 **Gradient Boosting**
 **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**

The objective is to test and compare these models to identify the one with the highest accuracy and F1 Score for classifying cancer types.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is `cancer_type.csv`, which contains features and labels for different cancer types. Features are used to predict the cancer type. The dataset is available in the repository.

## Results
The SVM model achieved the highest accuracy of 98.25%, closely followed by the ANN model with 97.37% accuracy. These results suggest that SVM is particularly effective for this classification task.
